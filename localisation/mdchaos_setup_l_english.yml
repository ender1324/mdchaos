 mdchaos.1.c: "Let the chaos begin!"
 mdchaos.1.d: "Use uncategorized event triggering!"
 mdchaos.1.d_tt: "This option should make repetition very scarce by disabling the percentage based category triggering BUT IT WILL MAKE UNHINGED EVENTS WAY MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN.\n\nNonetheless this is the recommended option right now due to the low amount of events in the mod. Use this if you hate repeating events."
